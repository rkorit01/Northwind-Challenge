# Northwind Challenge by Raviteja
For the Maven Northwind Challenge, you'll be working as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders, a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world.

As part of your role, you've been tasked with building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team. Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:

* Sales trends
* Product performance
* Key customers
* Shipping costs

The dashboard should be built to evolve and accommodate new data over time, but you've been encouraged by your manager to have insights & recommendations ready to share with the VPs. This is your chance to impress!
